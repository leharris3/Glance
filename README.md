# Update Nov. 2023: Muse is Dead ):
- I gave up on this app back in June. Turns out app dev is hard. Full-stack app dev is harder. Solo full-stack mobile app dev on a dating app is a bit of a crusade. I learned a ton from this project and feel proud of the little bit I did accomplish. However, if I ever do decide to build a social media app with the intent to deploy it â€“ I'm sure as hell going to have some help. Of course, feel free to use any of this code if you dare, I'm fairly certain it's all unusable.

# Muse: A Free Alternative to Freemium Dating
--- 
### Coming: May / June of 2023

- **Progress Update - 4/3/23**: User authentication and account creation are fully implemented. UI is rudimentary, yet relatively modern and useable. Currently undergoing intense rewrites for core feature of app (swipe page). Largest challenge is getting (not even sorting) relevant profiles and user-data in real time. Excited to implement more core features and do large-scale refactors in the coming months.

- **Description**: *Muse* is an IOS dating app exclusively available to current students of UNC Chapel Hill. Functionally it is similar to Tinder, Hinge, or any number of binary-match mechanism based apps.
- **Motivation**: To provide a competitive, premium online dating experience free of charge to a small, manageable user-base. Additionally to peruse my passion for app development by designing, building, and maintaining a moderately sized code base.

- *I will be posting assets and demos in the coming weeks, please feel free to reach out with any feedback or suggestions via my email: levlevi@email.unc.edu*
