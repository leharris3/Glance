# Sole: A Truely Free Dating App
--- 
### Coming May / June of 2023

- **Description**: *Sole* is an IOS dating app exclusively available to current students of UNC Chapel Hill. Functionally it is similar to Tinder, Hinge, etc. and is built with a binary matching system and embedded chat room. Sole additionally provides a novel suggestion algorithm to show users profiles they are **scientifically** more likely to be romantically compatible with.
- **Motivation**: High-quality romantic and social connections are fundamental to creating lasting human happiness. Unfortunately, most mobile dating apps are created with attention and monetization as top, or even sole priorities. Additionally, despite the elegance of the binary-match mechanism, modern dating apps are bloated with premium onboarding flows, and tacky additions to the majority of views. Sole aims to provide a premium, modern match making experience free of charge. Moreover, it is an attempt to create lasting relationships in a safe environment.

- *I will be posting assets and demos in the coming weeks, please feel free to reach out with any feedback or suggestions via my email: levlevi@email.unc.edu*
