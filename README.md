# Muse: A Free Alternative to Freemium Dating
--- 
### Coming: May / June of 2023

- **Progress Update - 4/3/23**: User authentication and account creation is fully implemented. UI is rudimentary, yet relatively modern and useable. Currently undergoing intense rewrites for core feature of app (swipe page). Largest challenge is getting (not even sorting) relevant profiles and user-data in real time. Excited to implement more core features and do large-scale refactors in the coming months.

- **Description**: *Muse* is an IOS dating app exclusively available to current students of UNC Chapel Hill. Functionally it is similar to Tinder, Hinge, or any number of binary-match mechanism based apps.
- **Motivation**: To provide a competitive, premium online dating experience free of charge to a small, manageable user-base. Additionally to peruse my passion for app development by designing, building, and maintaining a moderately sized code base.

- *I will be posting assets and demos in the coming weeks, please feel free to reach out with any feedback or suggestions via my email: levlevi@email.unc.edu
